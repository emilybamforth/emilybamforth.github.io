# Welcome!

My name is Emily and I am a second-year MPH student in Population and Family Health at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.

I am currently a student in P8105 (Data Science 1). As a part of this course, I am building this website as I learn more about the world of data science and R.

You can learn more about my academic and professional experience on the about page!
